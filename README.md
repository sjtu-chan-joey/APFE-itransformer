# AFPE-itransformer

**AFPE-iTransformer** (Adaptive Frequency Pruning Enhanced iTransformer) is a robust and efficient framework for multivariate time-series forecasting, tailored for noisy and complex environments such as spacecraft telemetry systems. This is the official implementation of our method proposed in:

## üîç Overview

AFPE-iTransformer addresses two major challenges in time-series forecasting:

- Modeling **long-term temporal dependencies**
- Adapting to **channel-specific noise and spectral redundancy**

It integrates:
- ‚úÖ Legendre Memory Units (LMU) for compact long-term history encoding
  
  LMU uses orthogonal Legendre polynomials to compress historical input sequences into a fixed-size memory representation.
  This enables the model to preserve long-term temporal dependencies without suffering from gradient decay, making it ideal for capturing trends in power consumption over extended periods.

- ‚úÖ Adaptive Top-$k$ Frequency Pruning for denoising
  
  This module applies a learnable, per-channel pruning mechanism in the frequency domain.
  By retaining only the top-$k$ spectral components, it removes noise while preserving the most predictive patterns.
  This greatly enhances robustness under real-world signal perturbations (e.g., solar flares, subsystem instability).

- ‚úÖ Inverted Transformer architecture for subsystem-level attention
  
We extend the iTransformer structure by (1) transposing the input to treat each channel (i.e., subsystem) as an attention token, enabling cross-subsystem dependency modeling;
and (2) applying a learnable Softmax excitation within each channel to highlight key temporal features. This dual-level attention improves both accuracy and interpretability in spacecraft telemetry forecasting.
